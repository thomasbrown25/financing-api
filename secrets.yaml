  Environment: Sandbox
# Products is a comma-separated list of products to use when
# initializing Link, e.g. Products: auth,transactions
# see https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#link-token-create-request-products for a complete list.
# Only institutions that support ALL listed products will be displayed in Link.
# If you don't see the institution you want in Link, remove any products you aren't using.
# Important: When moving to Production, make sure to update this list with only the products
# you plan to use. Otherwise, you may be billed for unneeded products.
# NOTE: Income_verification has to be used seperately from all other products due to the specific 
# flow.
  Products: auth,identity,transactions
# CountryCodes is a comma-separated list of countries to use when
# initializing Link, e.g. CountryCodes: US,CA.
# see https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#link-token-create-request-country-codes for a complete list
  CountryCodes: US,CA
# Optionally, if you add your access token here, the quickstart will skip the link flow, allowing you to
# start hitting endpoints immediately
